# Signal-Detection-Data-Analysis
This analysis uses two detectors located in Soudan Underground Laboratory to understand high energy neutron production by muons in an underground environment: a water-Cherenkov detector sensitive to high energy neutrons; and a gas-filled detector sensitive to charged particles like muons using data from both detector systems.
